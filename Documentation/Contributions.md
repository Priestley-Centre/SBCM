# Contributions

This code is best described as proof of concept. It is at an early stage of development. SBCM is being actively developed as part of an ongoing PhD by Will Rolls, and while we welcome modifications to the code, optimisation, or bugfixes, it would probably be a good idea to contact [Will](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Will_Rolls2) first, to make sure that you won't break something important or that your idea is not already being worked on.

## Bug reports

We have worked very hard to make sure that the model produces accurate and correct output as expected but, as with any project of this complexity, it is entirely possible that the code has errors. Please do point out any problems you encounter and any analysis you have done to identify and reproduce the problem. N.B. It is quite easy to break the code at this stage, and simply causing the model to crash is not a bug in itself. Please only report issues which allow the model to successfully run while producing erroneous output.
