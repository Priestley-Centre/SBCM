SBCM began life as an open-source implementation of the model described by [Sterman et al. (2018).](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaa512) to calculate estimates of carbon payback periods for the use of biomass fuel. We chose this model (which is simple, well described, and relatively easy to reproduce) to address the wide range of different experimental assumptions and methods that have been developed when looking at the carbon benefits and costs associated with using biomass fuel. In the process we identified a number of inconsistencies and errors within the original model and have built on the initial assumptions and parameterisations to produce a new tool for comparing calculations within the literature. 

This project is in ongoing development as part of a PhD by [Will Rolls](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Will_Rolls2). The version here is 

## Version control / changelog

### Current version

 - Version 0.9 Pre-release. It is broadly equivalent to the supplementary materials available with the [paper introducing the model (DOI: 10.1088/2515-7620/ab7ff3)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/ab7ff3). There are a few tweaks and updates required before we get to version 1.0 mostly to the documentation.
